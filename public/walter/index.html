                        <h2>About Creative Embedded</h2>
                        <p>Creative Embedded is an embedded software/firmware consulting company with a strong focus on Open-Source.
                        The majority of our projects are using Linux and Yocto/OpenEmbedded often combined with FPGA's for some added
                        flavour, but also small micro-controllers or 7u servers can be used if that's the platform that makes most sense.</p>
                        <p>The core of Creative Embedded is me: Walter Goossens, but I have a network of independent developers that can be
                        brought in if a specific skill is needed or the amount of work to be done is just too much for one man alone.</p>
                        <p>Before starting Creative Embedded I've been working in the Video Broadcast industry for almost 10 years where we made
                        24/7 running dedicated video appliances with FPGA's and processors running Linux.</p>
                        <p>During that time I've learned to love to achieve the impossible in an impossible time-frame but also to create solutions
                        that make much sense (once they're done) that you are amazed no one has thought of it before, it's the most logical solution!</p>
                        <p>Crossing the boundary between software and hardware is another point of interest to me. I'm a trained software engineer but
                        soon got intrigued by the power of HDL and noticed some difficult software problems are easily solved in HDL and the same is true
                        for complex HDL problems that are a breeze in software. Clever design and knowing what domain best solves a certain problem
                        is the key to success in more demanding embedded projects.</p>

                        <h2>Expertise</h2>
                        This is a (by no means complete) list of skills/techniques to give an impression of the things we do.
                        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                        The main languages we prefer to work with/in are C/C++, VHDL, Java, bash-scripting and PHP. We also use obj-c, Python, verilog, tcl,
                        Assembler (various archs), Perl, basic and many other languages if the job requires it.
                        <h3>Processors/architectures</h3>
                        Listing a bunch of processors architectures and mark them "skills" makes little sense, but instead we'll list some of the architectures
                        we have hands-on experience with.<BR>
                        From the ARM-family: iMX6/7 families, Xilinx Zynq/ZynqMP, Intel SoCFpga, STM32, SmartFusion, Raspberry Pi, XScale etc... From the
                        PowerPC familiy: Freescale 85xx, Apple G4. Various systems from the x86/x86_64 family (mostly as backend servers for embedded tagets).
                        Various softcores but mostly Nios2 and to a lesser extend MicroBlaze/PicoBlaze, RISC-V and OpenRISC.
                        <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
                        Most work is done on Linux, both developing with, developing on and developing for. We've also used ChibiOS and FreeRTOS for smaller
                        footprint projects. Some work is done on OS-X and Haiku-OS. When being both forced and overpaid we also use Windows.

                        <h2>Services</h2>
                        There are a number of ways we can help with your project:
                        <h3>System design assistence</h3>
                        When projects are in the early phase of development/specification it is best to take the time to really look into the design and make
                        sure each problem is solved in the correct domain. In the embedded world you really need to know harware in order to do proper software
                        design, and the same goes for knowing software when designing hardware.
                        <h3>Development in our own lab</h3>
                        The preferred way of working is that we develop the stuff you need in our own facility and share the results over GitHub/GitLab/etc.
                        We can also just send an unnumbered zip file with some magic binaries if that suits your workfow better.
                        <h3>Development on-site</h3>
                        We can also come in-house to help develop your project if that's needed or do a combination of both on-site development and development
                        from at our own lab.
                        <h3>Training</h3>
                        We can supply training tailored to your specific use case or give a general introduction to various embedded subjects.
                        <h3>Other ways we can help</h3>
                        There are various other ways we can help you and if you think of one not listed here, do not hesitate to contact us!
